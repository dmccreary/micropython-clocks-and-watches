This course gives junior high and high school students the tools to design and build their own digital clocks and smart watches using low-cost components. </p> <p>This website contains detailed instructions for finding low-cost parts  (many under $20/student) and customizing your custom clock and watch displays using MicroPython.</p> <p>These projects have only recently been possible due to the following developments:</p> <ol> <li>The 2021 release of the powerful $4 Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. It had almost 100x the power of the Arduino Uno and sold for 1/8th the price.</li> <li>The availability of low-cost high-contrast OLED and TFT displays for as low as $7 each.  When we use the $4 Raspberry Pi Pico our classrooms can create a development system for under $15.</li> <li>The support of highly-optimized drawing of complex ellipse and polygon shapes into the frame buffer by the MicroPython runtime. This only became available in version 20 of the standard MicroPython runtime released in April of 2023.  Before this every clock and watch project used custom math functions that slowed drawing times.</li> <li>The ability of WiFi-enabled microcontrollers that can synchronize with centralized time services using standard WiFi networks. We use the $5 Raspberry Pi Pico W in many of our projects.</li> <li>The availability of low-cost yet ultra-precise real-time clock chips like the DS3231.</li> </ol> <p>Our goal is to provide fun ways to teach computational thinking to a wide variety of students from 6th to 12th grades.  If you can type, we have fun lesson plans from drawing simple shapes to complex clock and watch face designs.</p>"},{"location":"#acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"<p>I want to thank everyone in the MicroPython community for sharing their code.

Owning their own devices and showing off these projects to their friends is also a big plus.</p> <p>At the core of  Project Based Learning (PBL)  is the desire to allow students to pick their own projects.  My role  as a mentor is to have a rich set of projects they can get  started on.  They may not understand all the components, but  to fix and modify the projects they end up learning  faster than if I gave them a dozen lectures with PowerPoint.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-timeless-allure-of-timekeeping-sparking-a-passion-for-coding-with-micropython-clocks-and-watches","title":"The Timeless Allure of Timekeeping: Sparking a Passion for Coding with MicroPython Clocks and Watches","text":"<p>In a world driven by digital innovation, the essence of time remains universally compelling.

The code needed to be complied and the entire program downloaded into the memory just to run a simple test.  You were limited to just 2K or RAM and the clock ran at a slow 16MhZ.</p> <p>Today the Raspberry Pi has enough RAM to run a full Python interpreter and 264K of RAM just for program memory.  It can run up to 150MhZ and has multiple cores that can be working on different tasks such as reading sensors and updating displays.</p> <p>In short, this power translates into fun projects that are easy to write.

They deepen their grasp of computational thinking by examining concepts like abstraction (focusing on relevant details) and decomposition (breaking large problems into smaller parts).  They proceed to use these concepts to customize clock and watch faces using graphic displays.</li> <li>Apply: As their skills grow, students practice wiring and programming a 128\u00d764 OLED display, interfacing with web services to fetch real-time data. They also implement stopwatches and timers, applying algorithms and pattern-matching techniques to manage user inputs and display outputs accurately.</li> <li>Analyze: Learners diagnose and troubleshoot various clock behaviors, studying how code efficiency and hardware choices influence device performance. They dissect timing errors, lag issues, and integration problems, refining both their programming and problem-solving skills.</li> <li>Evaluate: Working in teams, students test multiple clock designs to compare accuracy, power consumption, and user experience. They assess trade-offs---such as display readability vs. complexity---and refine solutions based on feedback, cost, and practicality.  They can also work with AI to design new clocks.</li> <li>Create: Ultimately, students design and assemble their own custom timekeeping projects, combining LEDs, OLED displays, push buttons, and encoders. This final challenge showcases their ability to unify hardware and code into a polished, functioning prototype.</li> </ol> <p>By the end of the course, students will have built a diverse collection of digital clocks, stopwatches, and timers while gaining a rich understanding of electronics, computational thinking, and MicroPython.

It is a little hard to read at first, but these kits are extremely popular. Link to the Binary Clock Project.  There are also several alternate layouts of how to display a binary clock.  There are six different NeoPixel strips, each strip requires about five minutes of soldering, so the assembly takes about an hour.  The total parts cost about $11.</li> <li>Seven Segment Clock The second requires building four seven-segment displays from the LED strip (or LED string) so the assembly time is significantly longer - about three hours if you are good with a soldering iron.

This requires tracking the previous state and only redrawing digits that have changed. Here's how we can improve it:</p> <p>The key improvements in this version include:</p> <ol> <li> <p>State Tracking: Added global variables to track the previous state of all display elements (digits, date, AM/PM, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p>Selective Updates: Only redraws elements that have changed since the last update:</p> </li> <li>Digits are only redrawn when their values change</li> <li>The date is only updated when it changes</li> <li>AM/PM indicator only updates when switching between AM and PM</li> <li> <p>The colon blinks by only updating its small area</p> </li> <li> <p>Localized Clearing: Instead of clearing the entire screen:</p> </li> <li>Each digit area is cleared individually before redrawing</li> <li> <p>Text areas are cleared in their specific regions before updating</p> </li> <li> <p>Initialization Handling: Added a <code>screen_initialized</code> flag to ensure the background is only drawn once at startup</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved Update Rate: Reduced the sleep time to 0.1 seconds for smoother updates while still maintaining efficiency</p> </li> </ol> <p>These changes should significantly reduce the flicker since we're only updating the parts of the screen that actually change. The blue background will now only be drawn once at startup, and subsequent updates will be localized to the specific areas that need to change.</p> <p>To use this improved version, simply replace the contents of your existing clock-main-with-flicker.py with this new code. The functionality remains the same, but the display should be much more stable with minimal flicker.</p> <p>this is a great example of how selective updates can make a big difference in display quality. Instead of redrawing the entire screen 10 times per second, we're now only updating the specific segments that change. For example, when displaying \"12:59\", only the \":59\" portion will update frequently. The \"12\" will stay static until it changes to \"1:00\". The colons blink by just toggling those few pixels rather than redrawing everything.</p> <p>This technique (known as \"dirty rectangle\" updating in graphics programming) is especially important for displays like the ST7735 where each pixel update takes a non-trivial amount of time. By minimizing the number of pixels we need to update, we get both better performance and a cleaner visual result.</p> <pre><code>from machine import Pin, SPI\nfrom utime import sleep, localtime\nimport ST7735\nimport config\n\n# Initialize SPI and display\nspi = machine.SPI(config.SPI_BUS, \n                  sck=Pin(config.SPI_SCL_PIN),\n                  mosi=Pin(config.SPI_SDA_PIN),\n                  baudrate=8000000)\n\ndisplay = ST7735.ST7735(spi, \n                        rst=config.SPI_RESET_PIN,\n                        ce=config.SPI_CS_PIN,\n                        dc=config.SPI_DC_PIN)\ndisplay.reset()\ndisplay.begin()\ndisplay.set_rotation(config.DISPLAY_ROTATION)\n\n# Define colors using RGB565 format\nBACKGROUND_COLOR = display.rgb_to_565(0, 0, 255)  # Blue background\nDIGIT_COLOR = display.rgb_to_565(255, 255, 255)   # White for digits\nTEXT_COLOR = display.rgb_to_565(255, 255, 0)      # Yellow for text\n\n# Previous state tracking\nprev_date = \"\"\nprev_hour_ten = -1\nprev_hour_right = -1\nprev_minute_ten = -1\nprev_minute_right = -1\nprev_second = -1\nprev_am_pm = \"\"\nscreen_initialized = False\n\nsegmentMapping = [\n    #a, b, c, d, e, f, g\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], # 0\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], # 1\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], # 2\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], # 3\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], # 4\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], # 5\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], # 6\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], # 7\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], # 8\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]  # 9\n]\n\ndef day_to_str(day_num):\n    \"\"\"Convert a day number (0-6) to a three-letter day abbreviation.\"\"\"\n    days = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']\n    if not 0 &lt;= day_num &lt;= 6:\n        raise ValueError(\"Day number must be between 0 and 6\")\n    return days[day_num]\n\ndef month_to_str(month_num):\n    \"\"\"Convert a month number (1-12) to a three-letter month abbreviation.\"\"\"\n    months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', \n             'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\n    if not 1 &lt;= month_num &lt;= 12:\n        raise ValueError(\"Month number must be between 1 and 12\")\n    return months[month_num - 1]\n\ndef clear_digit_area(x, y, width, height, color):\n    \"\"\"Clear the area where a digit was previously drawn.\"\"\"\n    display.draw_block(x, y, width, height, color)\n\ndef drawDigit(digit, x, y, width, height, thickness, color):\n    \"\"\"Draw a seven-segment digit on the display.\"\"\"\n    if digit &lt;

The example above is the famous Astronomical Clock called The Orloj which was built in Prague around 1400.  It remains an important tourist attraction in the city.</p> <p>Today, creating precise feature rich clocks is within the reach of anyone with $10 and a bit of curiosity.  Despite the fact that everyone uses their mobile phones to check the time, the landscape of creative and beautiful timekeeping devices continues to expand.  For example the market for beautiful Nixie tube clocks is perhaps larger than it has ever been due to the dedication of craftspeople like those people from Millclock in Ukraine.</p> <p></p> <p>I personally think that the Nixie Tube clocks, especially those created by Millclock are some of the  most pleasing forms of handcrafted artwork I have seen.  The amount of engineering that goes into manufacturing these 70 mm high retro-vacuum tubs is incredible.  Each wire in the tubes are made and assembled by hand, which is why a price of almost $2,000 for each clock is not surprising.</p> <p>It is interesting to note that many of the clocks in this course have features similar to the Millclock clocks such as syncing with time servers to get accurate times.  So you don't need a huge budget to get a precise clock these days!</p> <p>Regardless of your interest in timekeeping be it art, science, astronomy, being a maker, programming or AI, there are projects here to help you build your own highly personalized and customized timepiece using low cost components starting around $10.  These devices can be a platform for fun, learning computational thinking and artistic expression.</p> <p>One of the key things we learn about architecture choices is that there are few solutions that fit everyone's needs.  There are always trade offs.  You will find simple designs that are low-cost and easy to assemble in an hour.  You will also find complex designs that use exotic displays and integrate light and motion sensors to create a personalized experience for your device.</p> <p>First let take a look at the key architectural components of a timekeeping device.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#core-components","title":"Core Components","text":"<p>Let's start with a high-level view of the core components of an electronic clock.

They serve multiple purposes including setting the time, changing modes, and configuring alarms. While they may seem simple, buttons require careful programming consideration to handle issues like switch bounce -- the tendency for mechanical switches to generate multiple signals when pressed once.</p> <p>In our projects, we typically use momentary push buttons that are normally open, meaning they only complete the circuit when pressed. These buttons are connected to the Pico's GPIO pins configured with internal pull-up resistors. This configuration means the pin reads HIGH normally and LOW when the button is pressed, simplifying our circuit design by eliminating the need for external resistors.</p> <p>Button debouncing is handled in our code using both hardware (capacitors) and software (timing delays) techniques. The code in our projects typically implements a debounce delay of 50-200 milliseconds, preventing multiple accidental triggers from a single press. This is particularly important when setting time values, where accuracy is crucial.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#rotary-encoder-knobs","title":"Rotary Encoder Knobs","text":"<p>Rotary encoders provide an intuitive way to adjust values like hours and minutes in our clock projects. Unlike potentiometers that have fixed start and end positions, rotary encoders can rotate continuously in either direction. They work by generating two square wave signals (often called A and B) that are offset by 90 degrees, allowing us to determine both the direction and speed of rotation.</p> <p>The key advantage of rotary encoders in clock projects is their natural mapping to time adjustment -- clockwise rotation increases values while counterclockwise decreases them. Many of our projects use encoders with built-in push buttons, combining rotational input with selection capability in a single component. This allows users to both select what to adjust (by pressing) and make the adjustment (by rotating) with one control.</p> <p>Programming rotary encoders requires careful attention to interrupt handling, as we need to monitor both signal pins simultaneously to determine direction. Our code typically uses hardware interrupts to detect changes on either pin, then compares the states to determine rotation direction. We also implement acceleration, where faster rotation results in larger value changes, making it efficient to make both small adjustments and large changes.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#photosensors","title":"Photosensors","text":"<p>Photosensors add environmental awareness to our clock projects, enabling automatic brightness adjustment based on ambient light conditions. The most common type we use is the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), whose resistance varies inversely with light intensity. This simple component allows our displays to be clearly visible in bright daylight while avoiding harsh glare in darkness.</p> <p>Implementation of photosensors requires understanding analog-to-digital conversion, as these sensors output varying voltage levels rather than digital on/off signals. The Raspberry Pi Pico's ADC capabilities make it straightforward to read these analog values and convert them to usable brightness levels. Our projects typically map the sensor's full range to appropriate brightness values for our specific display type.</p> <p>Many of our advanced projects combine photosensor data with time-based algorithms to create sophisticated brightness control. For example, we might implement hysteresis to prevent rapid brightness changes in fluctuating light conditions, or combine time-of-day information with light levels to optimize display visibility while conserving power.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#the-microcontroller","title":"The MicroController","text":"<p>The microcontroller serves as the brain of our clock projects, executing the MicroPython code that manages timekeeping, input handling, and display updates.

The combination of an external RTC with the Pico's internal RTC can provide both accuracy and flexibility, with the external RTC serving as the authoritative time source while the internal RTC handles temporary timing needs.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#other-microcontrollers-that-run-micropython","title":"Other Microcontrollers that Run MicroPython","text":"<p>While our course focuses on the Raspberry Pi Pico, many other microcontrollers support MicroPython and can be used for clock projects. Popular alternatives include the ESP32 family, which offers built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, and various STM32 boards known for their processing power and extensive peripheral options.</p> <p>Each platform offers unique advantages. The ESP32, for instance, excels in wireless applications and includes a real-time clock (RTC) with battery backup capabilities. STM32 boards often provide more sophisticated analog interfaces and higher processing speeds, useful for complex display effects or audio generation.</p> <p>The key advantage of using MicroPython across these platforms is code portability. Many of our basic clock functions can be transferred between different microcontrollers with minimal modification, allowing students to experiment with different hardware while building on their existing knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#our-display","title":"Our Display","text":""},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#ledx","title":"LEDx","text":"<p>LED displays form the foundation of many clock projects, ranging from simple seven-segment displays to complex LED matrices. The most basic projects use individual LEDs for time indication, while more advanced designs employ multiplexed seven-segment displays that can show hours, minutes, and even seconds with minimal microcontroller pins.</p> <p>Seven-segment displays remain popular due to their excellent visibility and straightforward programming interface. Each digit consists of seven LEDs arranged in a figure-8 pattern, plus an optional decimal point. By controlling which segments are lit, we can display numbers 0-9 and some letters. Multiple digits are typically multiplexed -- rapidly switching between digits faster than the human eye can detect -- to create the illusion of simultaneous display while using fewer GPIO pins.</p> <p>For more advanced projects, we often use LED matrices that provide greater flexibility in displaying both numbers and custom graphics. These can be controlled through shift registers or specialized LED driver ICs, reducing the number of required microcontroller pins while enabling complex animations and transitions.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#graphic-displays-oled","title":"Graphic Displays (OLED)","text":"<p>OLED displays represent a significant step up in capabilities, offering full graphic control with excellent contrast and wide viewing angles. These displays communicate with the microcontroller via I2C or SPI protocols and can show both text and graphics. The most common resolution in our projects is 128x64 pixels, providing ample space for creative clock faces.</p> <p>The key advantage of OLED displays is their versatility. They can simulate traditional analog clock faces, display digital time in various fonts and sizes, and show additional information like temperature, humidity, or weather data. The high contrast ratio of OLED technology ensures excellent readability in various lighting conditions, while their low power consumption in displays with dark backgrounds makes them ideal for battery-powered projects.</p> <p>Programming OLED displays requires understanding basic graphics concepts like framebuffers and drawing primitives. Our projects use libraries that abstract these details while still allowing direct pixel control when needed. We can create smooth animations, implement multiple clock face designs, and even build interactive menus for settings and configuration.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/01-timekeeping-architecture/#speakers","title":"Speakers","text":"<p>In clock projects, speakers primarily serve for alarms and hourly chimes, though some advanced projects include more complex audio features.

These can reproduce more complex sounds and music, though they require more sophisticated driving circuits and careful power management. The Raspberry Pi Pico's PWM capabilities make it possible to generate various frequencies and even simple melodies without additional hardware.</p> <p>Advanced projects might include multiple sound effects, customizable alarm tones, or even voice announcements.

The conversion process involves sampling the analog voltage at regular intervals and converting it to digital values our code can process. The Pico's ADC can sample at up to 500,000 samples per second, far exceeding our typical needs for clock projects.</p> <p>Understanding ADC principles is essential for handling real-world inputs effectively.

Today your  lecture is on \"Real time Clocks\" like the old DS1307 and the newer super  accurate DS3231.  Give the full text of a 15-minute lecture before the  hands-on lab and mention where images should be inserted.</p> <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to today's exciting lecture on Real Time Clocks!  In our \"Programming Clocks and Watches\" course, we're going to dive into  the fascinating world of the good old DS1307 used in our classrooms and the new super accurate DS3231.</p> <p>First, let's talk about what a Real Time Clock (RTC) is.  An RTC is a computer chip that keeps track of the current time,  even when the main power is off. It's like a tiny, dedicated clock  inside your electronic devices. RTCs are found in computers,  smartphones, appliances, and many other gadgets that need to keep accurate time.</p> <p>Here is how the DS1307 is typically used in a microcontroller project.</p> <p></p> <p>The DS1307 is one of the most well-known RTCs.  We have a LOT of them lying around the lab. This little chip was first introduced in 2005 and has been widely used in various electronic projects. The DS1307 keeps track of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, and years. It communicates with the main processor using a protocol called I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit).</p> <p>Now, let's take a look at how the DS1307 works. It has a built-in crystal oscillator that vibrates at a specific frequency, acting as a precise clock source. The chip counts these oscillations to keep track of time. The DS1307 also has a small amount of battery-backed memory, allowing it to maintain the time even when the main power is off.</p> <p>Speaking of power, the DS1307 uses a small coin cell battery to keep the clock running when the main power is disconnected. This battery can last for several years, ensuring that your device always has the correct time.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, let's move on to the newer and more accurate DS3231. Released in 2011, the DS3231 is known for its incredible precision. It has a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO), which means it can maintain accurate timekeeping even when the temperature changes. This is important because temperature fluctuations can affect the frequency of regular crystal oscillators, causing the clock to drift over time.</p> Device Strength Accuracy (PPM) Seconds Drift Per Month Price DS1307 Low Cost \u00b120 \u00b152 $1 DS3231 Accuracy \u00b12 \u00b15 $3 <p>The DS1307 uses a standard crystal oscillator while the DS3231 uses a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO), explaining the accuracy difference. How accurate is the DS3231, you might ask? Well, it has a typical accuracy of \u00b12 parts per million (ppm), which translates to a drift of about 1 minute per year! In comparison, the DS1307 has an accuracy of around \u00b120 ppm, which means it can drift by about 10 minutes per year. That's a significant difference!</p> <p>[Insert image of I2C communication]</p> <p>Just like the DS1307, the DS3231 communicates with the main processor using the I2C protocol. It has a simple register-based interface that allows you to read and set the time easily.</p> <p>Now, let's talk about some fun applications of RTCs. One cool project you can build is a digital clock that always displays the correct time, even if it's been unplugged for a while. You can also create a data logger that records temperature, humidity, or other sensor readings along with precise timestamps. The possibilities are endless!</p> <p>In our hands-on lab today, we'll be working with both the DS1307 and the DS3231. You'll learn how to wire them up, set the time, and read the current time using a microcontroller. We'll also explore some practical examples and discuss how to choose the right RTC for your projects.</p> <p>So, get ready to have some fun with Real Time Clocks! Remember, whether you're building a simple clock or a complex data logging system, an RTC is an essential component that keeps everything running on time.</p> <p>Let's head to the lab and start tinkering with these amazing little chips!</p>"},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#testing-the-ds1307-and-ds3232-real-time-clocks","title":"Testing the DS1307 and DS3232 Real Time Clocks","text":""},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#hardware-configuration","title":"Hardware Configuration","text":""},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#ds1307-connections","title":"DS1307 Connections","text":"<ol> <li>CLK - clock</li> <li>DST - Data (incoming to Pico)</li> <li>RST - Reset</li> <li>VCC - must be 5 volts, not 3.2</li> <li>GND - ground</li> </ol> <p>We will use the lower right pins on the Pico so that the display can use the pins in the upper-right corner.</p> <p>These pin assignments are</p> <ol> <li>GP16 - far lower right - CLK</li> <li>GP17 - second from the bottom - DST</li> <li>GP18 - fourth pin up - RST</li> </ol> <p>Contents of config.py</p> <pre><code>CLK_PIN = 16\nDST_PIN = 17\nRST_PIN = 18\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#sample-ds1307-micropython-test-program-for-the-raspberry-pi-pico","title":"Sample DS1307 MicroPython Test Program for the Raspberry Pi Pico","text":"<pre><code>from machine import I2C, Pin\nimport config\n\nCLK_PIN = config.CLK_PIN\nDST_PIN = config.DST_PIN\nDS_PIN = config.DS_PIN\n\nprint(\"Clock on pin:\", CLK_PIN)\nprint(\"Data on pin:\", DST_PIN)\nprint(\"Data Select on pin:\", DS_PIN)\n\ni2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(CLK_PIN), sda=Pin(DST_PIN), freq=100000)\nscan_result = i2c.scan()\nprint(\"I2C addresses found:\", [hex(device_address) for device_address in scan_result])\n\nif 104 in scan_result:\n    print(\"PASS: DS1307 FOUND\")\nelse:\n    print(\"FAIL: DS1307 NOT FOUND\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#sample-test-result","title":"Sample Test Result","text":"<pre><code>Clock on pin: 17\nData on pin: 16\nData Select on pin: 18\nI2C addresses found: ['0x50', '0x68']\nPASS: DS1307 FOUND\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#full-test-of-ds1307","title":"Full Test of DS1307","text":"<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-\n\n\"\"\"I2C DS1307 showcase\"\"\"\n\nfrom ds1307 import DS1307\nfrom machine import I2C, Pin\nfrom utime import gmtime, sleep, time\nimport config\nCLK_PIN = config.CLK_PIN\nDST_PIN = config.DST_PIN\nDS_PIN = config.DS_PIN\n\n# DS1307 on 0x68\nI2C_ADDR = 0x68     # DEC 104, HEX 0x68\n\n# define custom I2C interface, default is 'I2C(0)'\n# check the docs of your device for further details and pin infos\n# this are the pins for the Raspberry Pi Pico adapter board\ni2c = I2C(0, scl=Pin(CLK_PIN), sda=Pin(DST_PIN), freq=800000)\nprint(i2c.scan())\nds1307 = DS1307(addr=I2C_ADDR, i2c=i2c)\n\n# get LCD infos/properties\nprint(\"DS1307 is on I2C address 0x{0:02x}\".format(ds1307.addr))\nprint(\"Weekday start is {}\".format(ds1307.weekday_start))\n\n# get the current RTC time\nprint(\"Current RTC time: {}\".format(ds1307.datetime))\n\n# set the RTC time to the current system time\nnow = gmtime(time())\nds1307.datetime = now\n\n# Print the date and time in ISO8601 format: 2023-04-18T21:14:22\nprint(\"Today is {:04d}-{:02d}-{:02d}T{:02d}:{:02d}:{:02d}\".format(\n    ds1307.year, ds1307.month, ds1307.day,\n    ds1307.hour, ds1307.minute, ds1307.second))\n\n# check whether this year is a leap year\nprint(\"Is this year a leap year? {}\".format(ds1307.is_leap_year(ds1307.year)))\n\n# get the day of the year\nprint(\"Today is day {} of {}\".format(\n    ds1307.day_of_year(year=ds1307.year, month=ds1307.month, day=ds1307.day),\n    ds1307.year))\n\n# halt the oscillator\nprint(\"The oscillator is currently active at {}? {}\".format(\n    ds1307.datetime, ds1307.halt))\nprint(\"Halt the oscillator and wait for 5 seconds ...\")\nds1307.halt = True\nsleep(5)\n\nprint(\"Current RTC time: {}\".format(ds1307.datetime))\n\nprint(\"Enable the oscillator and wait for 5 seconds ...\")\nds1307.halt = False\nsleep(5)\nprint(\"Current RTC time: {}\".format(ds1307.datetime))\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"lessons/rtc/13-rtc-explained/#test-result","title":"Test Result","text":"<pre><code>[80, 104]\nDS1307 is on I2C address 0x68\nWeekday start is 0\nCurrent RTC time: (2024, 12, 27, 20, 29, 47, 4, 362)\nToday is 2024-12-27T20:29:51\nIs this year a leap year?

This value is commonly known as the Unix timestamp or epoch time.  It is a widely used standard for representing points in time and is  independent of time zones.</p> <p>In our example, <code>time()</code> returned 1735332067.

Throughout the course, students will be guided by moving from foundational knowledge, and terms to creative invention.</p> <ol> <li>Remember: Students begin by identifying essential electronic components---breadboards, microcontrollers, buttons, knobs, and displays---and recalling the fundamental concepts of MicroPython programming.</li> <li>Understand: Through teacher-led demonstrations, students explore how timing functions, input/output operations, and hardware connections work together to create a basic LED clock. They deepen their grasp of computational thinking by examining concepts like abstraction (focusing on relevant details) and decomposition (breaking large problems into smaller parts).</li> <li>Apply: As their skills grow, students practice wiring and programming a 128\u00d764 OLED display, interfacing with web services to fetch real-time data. They also implement stopwatches and timers, applying algorithms and pattern-matching techniques to manage user inputs and display outputs accurately.</li> <li>Analyze: Learners diagnose and troubleshoot various clock behaviors, studying how code efficiency and hardware choices influence device performance. They dissect timing errors, lag issues, and integration problems, refining both their programming and problem-solving skills.</li> <li>Evaluate: Working in teams, students test multiple clock designs to compare accuracy, power consumption, and user experience. They assess trade-offs---such as display readability vs. complexity---and refine solutions based on feedback, cost, and practicality.</li> <li>Create: Ultimately, students design and assemble their own custom timekeeping projects, combining LEDs, OLED displays, push buttons, and encoders. This final challenge showcases their ability to unify hardware and code into a polished, functioning prototype.</li> </ol> <p>By the end of the course, students will have built a diverse collection of digital clocks, stopwatches, and timers while gaining a rich understanding of electronics, computational thinking, and MicroPython.

This number reflects two items: the company that made the device (Vendor ID) and the device product type (Product ID).

This means that the data wires are not present in your USB cable or one of the wires is broken or not connecting.</p> <p>Step 3: Looking Up the USB Driver The operating system will take this USB ID and then look-up the right software and then run that software.  In UNIX and Mac systems this will amount to making the USB device appear in the <code>/dev/cu*</code> area.

This can be tricky when we use breadboards where we can accidentally pull one wire out.</p> <p>To keep our displays running reliably, we can use a 20 cm ribbon cable and some hot glue to make a connector that is easy to hook up and be much more reliable.</p> <p>We start by purchasing some 20cm long Male-Female Dupont ribbon connectors from eBay. The price should be about $8 for 120 connectors. Make sure to get the Male-Female version.</p> <p></p> <p>We then separate out seven of these wires trying to use the black and red colors in the GND and VCC edge of the group of wires.</p> <p></p> <p>You can see a close-up of each of the colors and their connections in the picture below.</p> <p></p> <p>At the other end of the cable, we need to make a small change in the order of the cable. Here are the changes:</p> <ol> <li>We separate the red wire from the rest of the group and connect the red to the 3.3V regulated output of the Raspberry Pi Pico.  All our displays run on 3.3v now.</li> <li>We move the back GND wire to be in between the blue and purple CS and DC wires. This allows the row of all the wires to be connected in a single block of wires.</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>We can then plug this group of wires directly into the breadboard from breadboard rows 3 to 9. This is shown below.  Make sure the black GND is on the Pico GND on row 8 of the breadboard.</p> <p></p> <p>We designed these connections with the following rules:</p> <ol> <li>The Clock (SCL) and Data (SDA) MUST be connected to rows 4 and 5 respectively because this is where SPI0 CLK and SPI0 TX are located.</li> <li>The other three signals RES, DC and CS can be on pin so we will use the rows that make the cable connectors direct to rows 6, 7 and 9. Note that GND is on breadboard row 8 which I mark with a black marker.</li> </ol> <p>We have found that once we create these cable assemblies with hot glue to keep the pins in the right order it makes it much easier to connect the displays.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Note that we still MUST make sure that the black wire in the wiring harness is connected to the GND. It is easy to get the cable reversed so make sure to double-check the cable orientation before you use power on the board.</p> <p>For younger students, don't be shy about providing a few color-coded hints on the breadboard to guide their assembly process.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"setup/04-led-clocks/","title":"LED Clocks","text":"<p>Our strategy for teaching is to provide a base set of examples of working clocks and watches.
